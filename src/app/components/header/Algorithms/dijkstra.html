    <h1 class="text-center">Dijkstra's Algorithm</h1>
    <p>Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It works for graphs with non-negative weights.</p>

    <h3>How Dijkstra's Algorithm works:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Set the starting node's distance to 0 and all other nodes' distances to infinity.</li>
      <li>Mark all nodes as unvisited. Set the starting node as the current node.</li>
      <li>For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.</li>
      <li>Once all neighbors are considered, mark the current node as visited.</li>
      <li>Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance as the new current node and repeat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Applications:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Network routing algorithms.</li>
      <li>GPS navigation systems.</li>
      <li>Shortest path algorithms in road maps.</li>
    </ul>
